    Most start “caring” about environment when they are close to an ecological disaster. As in many other respects here
    also Huawei differs from other giant companies. It cares about environment and cultivates the idea <a href="http://www1.huawei.com/en/solutions/go-greener/hw-001339.htm">«Green Communications»</a>.

<div>
    <h2>Power of the mind</h2>
    Admit that you have often wandered on who might have thought of creating a specific device or writing a specific
    program, which has now become an inseparable part of our dayly lives. All these were once just a “thought” and only
    after lots of hard work they had become a device or a program. Huawei claims that the most precious ability is the
    power of the mind to think. Prioritizing constant development, innovation and original thinking, specialists at
    Huawei pay special attention to keeping the vibe of the “power of the mind''. For example, the managers of the
    company are often asked to read unrelated literature, so that they have open and broad thinking opportunities.

    As if all this is not enough the company continues to demonstrate its confidence and “conquering” spirit. Huawei
    officials are positive that by year 2021 they will become the absolute leaders in the field. Let’s wait and see,
    shall we.
