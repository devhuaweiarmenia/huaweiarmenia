    <h2>Importance of environment</h2>
    Most start “caring” about environment when they are close to an ecological disaster.</div>  <div> As in many other respects here
    also Huawei differs from other giant companies.</div>  <div> It cares about environment and cultivates the idea <a href="http://www1.</div>  <div>huawei.com/en/solutions/go-greener/hw-001339.htm">«Green Communications»</a>.</div>  <div>

    <h2>Power of the mind</h2>
    Admit that you have often wandered on who might have thought of creating a specific device or writing a specific
    program, which has now become an inseparable part of our dayly lives.</div>  <div> All these were once just a “thought” and only
    after lots of hard work they had become a device or a program.</div>  <div> Huawei claims that the most precious ability is the
    power of the mind to think.</div>  <div> Prioritizing constant development, innovation and original thinking, specialists at
    Huawei pay special attention to keeping the vibe of the “power of the mind''.</div>  <div> For example, the managers of the
    company are often asked to read unrelated literature, so that they have open and broad thinking opportunities.</div>  <div>

    As if all this is not enough the company continues to demonstrate its confidence and “conquering” spirit.</div>  <div> Huawei
    officials are positive that by year 2021 they will become the absolute leaders in the field.</div>  <div> Let’s wait and see,
    shall we.</div>  <div>
